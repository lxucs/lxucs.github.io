## About

I am currently a PhD candidate of Computer Science at Emory University, and my main research focus is Natural Language
Processing (NLP), advised by Dr. [Jinho Choi](https://www.emorynlp.org/faculty/jinho-choi). I have been working on NLP-related research projects on the following subjects: (1) various document understanding tasks, including coreference
resolution, information extraction, machine reading comprehension (2) cross-lingual transfer on downstream tasks (3) dialogue-related tasks and adaptations (4) NLP applications on healthcare.

My current research interests: (1) **information extraction** under different settings (2) **dialogue**-related tasks and chatbot management.
