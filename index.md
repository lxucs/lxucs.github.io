## About Me

I am currently a Research Scientist at **WeChat AI, Tencent**, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP).
I recently graduated with PhD of Computer Science from **[Emory](https://www.emory.edu/)**, advised by Dr. [Jinho Choi](https://www.emorynlp.org/faculty/jinho-choi). I was also co-advised by Dr. [Fei Liu](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~fliu40/) in 2023.

Before Emory, I completed my bachelor's degrees at [ECNU](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/) and [CSU](https://compsci.colostate.edu/). Following this, I worked as a Software Engineer for two years before returning to graduate school.

## Research Interests

My past studies addressed topics around **document understanding**, including coreference resolution, information extraction, and semi/weak supervision.

I am currently engaged in research with an overall interest on **narrative comprehension**:<br>
 • Next-Gen Narrative Tasks and Assessments<br>
 • Global Context Modeling and Comprehension

*I am actively looking for motivated students to collaborate on NLP research.*
