## About Me

I am currently a Research Scientist at **WeChat AI, Tencent**, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP).
I recently obtained my PhD of Computer Science from **Emory University**, advised by Dr. [Jinho Choi](https://www.emorynlp.org/faculty/jinho-choi), and also co-advised by Dr. [Fei Liu](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~fliu40/) in 2023.

## Research Interests

My past studies have addressed the following topics around **document understanding**:<br>
 • Tasks: coreference resolution, information extraction, summarization, reading comprehension<br>
 • Settings: semi/weak supervision, cross-lingual transfer

I am currently working on several new exciting projects on **narrative understanding**, pushing for next-gen document comprehension under the LLM era. Papers are coming soon!

*I am actively looking for motivated students to collaborate on NLP research. Please contact me by emails if you are interested in any research collaborations or discussions.*
