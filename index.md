## About Me

I am a PhD candidate of Computer Science at Emory University, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) research, advised by Dr. [Jinho Choi](https://www.emorynlp.org/faculty/jinho-choi). I am also co-advised by Dr. [Fei Liu](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~fliu40/) in Spring 2023.

## Research Interests

My overall research interests focus around document understanding. My past work has studied on various related tasks and settings:
- tasks: coreference resolution, information extraction, summarization, reading comprehension
- settings: cross-lingual transfer, weak supervision, domain adaptation

For my future research, I am particularly interested in addressing certain challenges in long document understanding, as well as new tasks to further push for next-gen document comprehension.
