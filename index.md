## About Me

I am a PhD candidate of Computer Science in **Emory University**, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) research, advised by Dr. [Jinho Choi](https://www.emorynlp.org/faculty/jinho-choi). I am also co-advised by Dr. [Fei Liu](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~fliu40/) in Spring 2023.

I will be joining **WeChat AI, Tencent** as a Research Scientist, after my PhD graduation in summer 2023.

*I am actively looking for motivated students to collaborate with me on NLP research. Please contact me by emails if you are interested in research collaborations or any discussions.*

## Research Interests

My overall research interests focus around **document understanding**. My past work has studied various related tasks and settings:
- Tasks: coreference resolution, information extraction, summarization, reading comprehension
- Settings: cross-lingual transfer, weak supervision, domain adaptation

For my future research, I am particularly interested in addressing certain challenges in long document understanding, as well as new tasks to further push for next-gen document comprehension.
