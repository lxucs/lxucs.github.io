## About

I am currently a PhD student of Computer Science at Emory University, and my main research focus is Natural Language
Processing (NLP), advised by Prof. [Jinho Choi](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~choi/home.html). I have been working on NLP research projects related with: (1) various document understanding tasks, including coreference
resolution, machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, document classification (2) cross-lingual transfer on downstream tasks (3) language model scoring.
